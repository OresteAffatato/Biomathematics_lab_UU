# Biomathematics_lab_UU

In this repository you can find the material for the lab on Mathematical approaches to Biology, course in Preparation for research with focus on new drug targets, Biomedicine programme, Uppsala University (Sweden).

It is an introduction level lab of Mathematical modelling applied to Biology, with the aim to provide the students with tools to engage in more complex academical readings.

The file Statistics_handout.pdf is the main text of the lab. It is suggested to read through it and complete the exercises at the end of each chapter. 

To create the datasets, run the packages and do the analyses I used R version 4.2.1

Any suggestion to improve this lab is more than welcome! ðŸ˜Ž
